# Teacher Dashboard Fix

## Issue Fixed
**404 Not Found** errors for teacher dashboard endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/stats` - 404 Not Found
- `GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/activity` - 404 Not Found

## Problem Identified
The teacher dashboard was trying to access endpoints that didn't exist on the server. The client expected:
- `/api/v1/dashboard/teacher/stats`
- `/api/v1/dashboard/teacher/activity`

But the server only had teacher routes at:
- `/api/v1/teacher/dashboard/stats`
- `/api/v1/teacher/dashboard/activity`

## Root Cause
**Path mismatch between client and server**:
- **Client expects**: `/api/v1/dashboard/teacher/*`
- **Server provides**: `/api/v1/teacher/dashboard/*`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Teacher Dashboard Routes

#### `server/src/routes/teacher-dashboard.js`
Created a new route file with the expected endpoints:

```javascript
// ✅ New endpoints at expected paths
router.get('/teacher/stats', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Teacher dashboard stats logic
});

router.get('/teacher/activity', authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
  // Teacher recent activity logic
});
```

### 2. Registered Routes in Main App

#### `server/src/app.js`
Added the new teacher dashboard routes:

```javascript
// ✅ Register teacher dashboard routes
app.use('/api/v1/dashboard', require('./routes/teacher-dashboard'));
```

## API Endpoints Now Available

### **Teacher Dashboard Endpoints**
```
GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/stats - Get teacher dashboard statistics
GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/activity - Get teacher recent activity
```

### **Response Structure**

#### Teacher Stats Response
```json
{
  "materialsCreated": 5,
  "activeAssignments": 3,
  "students": 12,
  "completionRate": 85
}
```

#### Teacher Activity Response
```json
{
  "activity": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "type": "material_created",
      "description": "Created material: Colors and Shapes",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "type": "assignment_created", 
      "description": "Created assignment: Math Practice",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-14T15:45:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Data Sources

### **Teacher Stats Calculation**
- **Materials Created**: Count of materials where `creator_id = teacherId`
- **Active Assignments**: Count of assignments where `teacher_id = teacherId`
- **Students**: Count of students where `teacher_id = teacherId`
- **Completion Rate**: Calculated based on active assignments

### **Teacher Activity Sources**
- **Recent Materials**: Last 5 materials created by teacher
- **Recent Assignments**: Last 5 assignments created by teacher
- **Combined Activity**: Merged and sorted by creation date

## Security Features

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- ✅ All endpoints require authentication (`authMiddleware`)
- ✅ Role-based access control (only `teacher` role allowed)
- ✅ Teacher can only see their own data (`teacherId = req.user.id`)

### **Data Isolation**
- ✅ Teachers only see their own materials
- ✅ Teachers only see their own assignments
- ✅ Teachers only see their own students

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Teacher Dashboard Access
1. **Login as a teacher**
2. **Navigate to**: Teacher dashboard
3. **Expected**: No 404 errors in console
4. **Expected**: Dashboard stats display correctly
5. **Expected**: Recent activity shows teacher's activities

### 2. Test API Endpoints
1. **Open Browser Dev Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Refresh teacher dashboard**
4. **Look for**:
   - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/stats` - Status 200
   - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/teacher/activity` - Status 200
5. **Expected**: Both endpoints return data successfully

### 3. Test Data Accuracy
1. **Create some materials as teacher**
2. **Create some assignments as teacher**
3. **Refresh dashboard**
4. **Expected**: Stats reflect actual teacher data
5. **Expected**: Activity shows recent teacher actions

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Teacher dashboard loads without 404 errors
- Dashboard stats show actual teacher data
- Recent activity displays teacher's recent actions
- No console warnings about API unavailability
- Proper authentication and authorization

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- 404 errors for teacher dashboard endpoints
- Console warnings about API unavailability
- Fallback data being used instead of real data
- Authentication or authorization errors

## Debugging Steps (if still failing)

### 1. Check Route Registration
```bash
# Verify routes are registered
grep -n "teacher-dashboard" server/src/app.js
```

### 2. Check Authentication
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(localStorage.getItem('token'));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
```

### 3. Test API Directly
```bash
# Test the endpoints directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1/dashboard/teacher/stats

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1/dashboard/teacher/activity
```

### 4. Check Server Logs
```bash
# Look for route registration and requests
tail -f server/logs/app.log
```

## Key Lessons

### **Path Consistency**
- Client and server must use the same API paths
- Route registration must match client expectations
- Always verify endpoint paths in both client and server

### **Error Handling**
- Check both client and server logs
- Verify route registration in main app
- Test API endpoints directly

### **Data Validation**
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization
- Verify data isolation (teachers only see their data)
- Test with actual teacher data

## Next Steps
Once the fix is confirmed working:
1. Test with different teacher accounts
2. Verify data accuracy across different teachers
3. Test dashboard functionality with real data
4. Ensure proper error handling for edge cases
