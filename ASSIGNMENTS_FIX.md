# Assignments Page Fix

## Issue Fixed
The 404 error when accessing `/assignments` was caused by incorrect route import in the main application file.

## Problems Identified
1. **Wrong route import**: App was importing `assignments.routes.js` instead of `assignments.js`
2. **Duplicate model associations**: Assignment model had conflicting associations
3. **Missing endpoint**: The `/assignments/teacher` endpoint existed but wasn't accessible

## Changes Made

### Server-Side Fixes

#### `server/src/app.js`
1. **Fixed route import**:
   - Changed from `require('./routes/assignments.routes')` 
   - To `require('./routes/assignments')`

#### `server/src/models/index.js`
1. **Fixed duplicate associations**:
   - Removed duplicate Assignment associations
   - Standardized association aliases:
     - `teacher` for User association
     - `class` for Class association
     - `school` for School association

### API Endpoints Available

#### 1. Get Teacher Assignments
```
GET /api/v1/assignments/teacher
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response:**
```json

      "title": "Math Assignment",
      "description": "Complete exercises 1-10",
      "instructions": "Show your work",
      "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
      "teacherId": "teacher-uuid",
      "classId": "class-uuid",
      "schoolId": "school-uuid",
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",

      },
      "studentAssignments": [

            "lastName": "Doe"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Create Assignment
```
POST /api/v1/assignments
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "title": "Math Assignment",
  "description": "Complete exercises 1-10",
  "instructions": "Show your work",
  "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "classId": "class-uuid"
}
```

#### 3. Submit Assignment (Parent)
```
POST /api/v1/assignments/submit/:assignmentId
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "studentId": "student-uuid",
  "submissionText": "Here is my work..."
}
```

#### 4. Grade Assignment (Teacher)
```
POST /api/v1/assignments/grade/:studentAssignmentId
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "grade": 85,
  "feedback": "Great work!"
}
```

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Assignments Page Access
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/assignments`
- **Expected**: Page loads without 404 errors
- **Expected**: Teacher assignments are displayed (if logged in as teacher)

### 2. Test API Endpoint
1. **Open Browser Dev Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Refresh the page**
4. **Look for**: `GET /api/v1/assignments/teacher`
5. **Expected**: Status 200 (not 404)
6. **Expected**: Response contains assignment data

### 3. Test as Different Roles
- **Teacher**: Should see their assignments
- **School Admin**: Should see appropriate access
- **Parent**: Should see student assignments

### 4. Check Server Logs
1. **Look at terminal/server logs**
2. **Expected**: No 404 errors for assignments
3. **Expected**: Successful database queries

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Success Indicators**
- Assignments page loads without errors
- Teacher assignments are displayed correctly
- API endpoints return proper data
- No duplicate association errors
- Proper role-based access

### ❌ **Failure Indicators**
- 404 errors for assignments endpoints
- "EagerLoadingError" in server logs
- Empty assignment lists
- Authentication errors

## Security Features

### ✅ **Authorization**
- Teacher role verification for assignments
- School-level data isolation
- Proper authentication middleware
- Role-based endpoint access

### ✅ **Validation**
- Assignment ownership verification
- Class ownership verification
- Student assignment verification
- Input validation for submissions

## Debugging Steps (if still failing)

### 1. Check Route Registration
```bash
# Verify assignments route is registered
grep -r "assignments" server/src/app.js
```

### 2. Check Model Associations
```bash
# Verify Assignment model associations
grep -A 10 -B 5 "Assignment.belongsTo" server/src/models/index.js
```

### 3. Test API Directly
```bash
# Test the endpoint directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/v1/assignments/teacher
```

### 4. Check Database
```bash
# Verify assignments table exists
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d ecd_materials -c "SELECT * FROM \"Assignment\" LIMIT 5;"
```

## Next Steps
Once the fix is confirmed working:
1. Test assignment creation functionality
2. Test assignment submission (parent role)
3. Test assignment grading (teacher role)
4. Verify all assignment-related features work correctly
