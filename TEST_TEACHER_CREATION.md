# Testing Teacher Creation Fix

## Issue Fixed
The 400 Bad Request error when creating teachers was caused by:
1. Field name mismatch: `school_id` vs `schoolId` in database queries
2. Double password hashing (manual + model hook)
3. Missing validation and error handling

## Changes Made

### Server-Side Fixes (`server/src/routes/school-admin.js`)
1. **Fixed field names**: Changed `school_id` to `schoolId` in all queries
2. **Removed double hashing**: Removed manual bcrypt.hash() since User model has a hook
3. **Added validation**: Email format, password length, required fields
4. **Improved error handling**: Specific error messages for different failure types
5. **Fixed attribute names**: Changed `first_name` to `firstName` in includes

### Client-Side Improvements (`client/src/pages/ManageTeachersPage.js`)
1. **Better error handling**: Shows specific error messages from server
2. **Success feedback**: Shows success message when teacher is created

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you're logged in as a school admin
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/manage-teachers`

### Test Cases

#### 1. Valid Teacher Creation
- Fill in all required fields:
  - First Name: "John"
  - Last Name: "Doe"
  - Email: "john.doe@school.com"
  - Password: "password123"
- Click "Create Teacher"
- **Expected**: Success message, teacher appears in list

#### 2. Missing Required Fields
- Leave one or more fields empty
- Click "Create Teacher"
- **Expected**: Error message listing missing fields

#### 3. Invalid Email Format
- Enter invalid email like "invalid-email"
- Fill other fields
- Click "Create Teacher"
- **Expected**: "Invalid email format" error

#### 4. Short Password
- Enter password less than 6 characters
- Fill other fields
- Click "Create Teacher"
- **Expected**: "Password must be at least 6 characters long" error

#### 5. Duplicate Email
- Create a teacher with email "test@school.com"
- Try to create another teacher with same email
- **Expected**: "Email already exists" error

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Teacher creation should work without 400 errors
- ✅ Proper validation messages for invalid data
- ✅ Success feedback when teacher is created
- ✅ Teachers appear in the list after creation
- ✅ No double password hashing issues

## Debugging
If issues persist, check:
1. Server logs for detailed error messages
2. Database connection status
3. User authentication (school admin role)
4. Network tab in browser dev tools for API responses
